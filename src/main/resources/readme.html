<h1>NCI Edit Tab</h1>

NCI Edit Tab provides a customized collection of editing operations that commonly arise in developing complex terminologies. 
These operations include splitting, merging, cloninsldkjslddjlsg, and retirement of classes. Often one modeler is responsible for
reviewing and approving changes of others. Edit Tab provides historical tracking and special tagging of classes to track these
operations.
